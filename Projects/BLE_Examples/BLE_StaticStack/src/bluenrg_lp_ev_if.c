 *        assigned by the Controller, and passed to the Host in this event. If
 *        the connection establishment fails, this event shall be provided to
 *        the Host that had issued the LE_Create_Connection command. If this
 *        event is unmasked and LE Connection Complete event is unmasked, only
 *        the LE Enhanced Connection Complete event is sent when a new
 *        connection has been completed. This event indicates to the Host that
